Being inspired by wanting to track my expenses to know where my money goes on a monthly basis I created this expense tracker. 
I used: 
- Local storage to store the data when i would leave the page.
- Stored the data in an object so it would be eaiser to retrieve the data.
- Pulled the date and time of when you enter your expense so you keep track on how often you spend and when you spent.
